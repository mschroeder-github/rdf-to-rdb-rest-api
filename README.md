# Bridging the Technology Gap Between Industry and Semantic Web: Generating Databases and Server Code From RDF

Despite great advances in the area of Semantic Web, industry rather seldom adopts Semantic Web technologies and their storage and query concepts.
Instead, relational databases (RDB) are often deployed to store business-critical data, which are accessed via REST interfaces.
Yet, some enterprises would greatly benefit from Semantic Web related datasets which are usually represented with the Resource Description Framework (RDF).
To bridge this technology gap, we propose a fully automatic approach that generates suitable RDB models with REST APIs to access them.
